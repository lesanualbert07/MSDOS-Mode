# MSDOS-Mode

Welcome to the MSDOS-Mode repository!

# About

Remember MS-DOS Mode from Windows 98? Well now you got it on Windows 10/8/8.1/7

# Notes & Guide

Please note that im new at github and github for me is like a whole bunch of wires that i have to connect every wire the right way

The MS-DOS Mode will ONLY kill the process of explorer.exe (File Explorer) So do the following:
**Check if you are in a process of actioning on a file/folder (Example: Deleting a huge folder, copying a huge folder, etc.)**
**If you are, Please wait until the process finishes so you can start MS-DOS Mode freely**

To start your normal computer again, Type in "explorer.exe" and close the Command Prompt manually
***WARNING: CLOSING COMMAND PROMPT USING "exit" OR WITH THE "X" BUTTON WITHOUT TYPING "explorer.exe" WILL RESULT IN A BLANK SCREEN***

Programs not minimized may stay in the MS-DOS-Mode

wait i said ms-dos too many times, how about "command prompt only"?
